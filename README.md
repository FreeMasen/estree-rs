# ESTree 
ESTree is an informal specification of the ECMAScript Abstract Syntax Tree.
For more information you can review the spec [here](https://github.com/estree/estree).

Currently this library has an interface for the `es5.md` specification. 
I hope to expand it to include all of the specs listed in the ESTree repo.
